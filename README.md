# Spotify Stats!
a web app that generates visually appealing cards highlighting users' spotify activity including their favourite genres, songs, and artists. spotify stats is an updated version of spotify user visualizer.
# notes
<b>
❗ this project has been deployed, but is still in development mode. this means that it only works with those who have their
spotify email added to the app since there is a user limit to the spotify api.</b>
